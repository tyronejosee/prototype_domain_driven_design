# **Prototype Domain-driven Design**

This project is an implementation of a web application based on Django and Django REST Framework following the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The project's architecture is designed to maintain a clear separation between the different domain components, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## üìÇ **Project Structure**

The project follows a DDD-based structure:

```bash
project_root/
|-- config/                   # Global configurations
|-- apps/
|   |-- __init__.py           # Application initialization
|   |-- <app>/
|       |-- domain/           # Domain logic (Entities, Value Objects, Repositories)
|       |-- application/      # Use cases and application services
|       |-- infrastructure/   # Concrete implementations (ORM, APIs, Serializers)
|       |-- presentation/     # Views and endpoints
|-- shared/                   # Shared logic
|-- tests/                    # Unit and integration tests
|-- manage.py
|-- requirements.txt          # Dependencies with pip (alternative to Poetry)
|-- README.md
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation and Configuration**

- Clone the repository
